# Logistic-Regression-Multiclass-Classification
Logistic Regression Multiclass Classification
Logistic regression is used for classification problems in machine learning. This notebook will show you how to use sklearn logisticregression class to solve multiclass classification problem to predict hand written digit. We will use sklearn load_digits to load readily available dataset from sklearn library and train our classifier using that information.
